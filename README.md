# ATtiny10Programmer
An Arduino-based programmer code and example AVR assembly programs written for ATtiny10.

* ATtiny10Programmer.ino is my original programmer code for Arduino.
* ATtiny4_5_9_10_20_40Programmer.ino is the updated version thanks to Keri DuPrey.
* The asm files are useful example code for people learning AVR assembly.
